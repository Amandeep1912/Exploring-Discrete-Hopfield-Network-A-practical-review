# Exploring Discrete Hopfield Network: A Practical Review

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation and analysis of the **Discrete Hopfield Network**, a type of recurrent artificial neural network used for associative memory. The project aims to provide a practical review of the Hopfield network, demonstrating its ability to store and recall patterns using energy minimization.

## Features
- Implementation of the **Discrete Hopfield Network** in Python
- Pattern storage and retrieval using the Hopfield model
- Noise tolerance and error correction analysis
- Interactive demonstration of pattern convergence

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Amandeep1912/Exploring-Discrete-Hopfield-Network-A-practical-review.git
cd Exploring-Discrete-Hopfield-Network-A-practical-review
```

Run the main script to see the Hopfield network in action:
```bash
python hopfield_network.ipynb
```

## How It Works
1. The network is trained using Hebbian learning to store binary patterns.
2. Given a noisy or incomplete input, the network iterates to converge to the closest stored pattern.

## Example Output
After running the script, you should see a visualization of stored and retrieved patterns.
