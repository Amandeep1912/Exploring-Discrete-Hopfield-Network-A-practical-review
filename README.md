This code implements a Hopfield network to denoise a grayscale image by learning from a clean reference image and iteratively updating pixel values based on the stored pattern.

**Observations and Conclusion:**

It can be concluded that increasing the image size (e.g., from 100×100 to 150×150) improves the performance of the Hopfield network denoising by:
1. Preserving More Details:
2. Better Generalization:
3. Reduced Information Loss:
4. More Effective Hebbian Learning:
 
Also, denoising is improved when the Hopfield network is trained with multiple clean images. It is because it leads to a more generalized weight matrix that enhances noise removal compared to using a single reference image.
